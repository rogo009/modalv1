## in index file create modal window, then modal content, then modal header
## modal footer is optional
## target the modal window
## target the open modal button to change display value of the modal to block instead of "none"
## &times; in the index file is better than just using a plain text X. as the plain text X will grow and scale, but the &times; will not scale - good to know
